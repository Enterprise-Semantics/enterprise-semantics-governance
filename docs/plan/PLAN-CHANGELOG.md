## [0.1.0] ; 2026-09-02 ; Phase 0 in progress

### Added

- Initial `plans/PLAN.md` authored (Phases 0;;6, repo inventory, WBS, dependency graph, plan-keeper spec, decisions log, machine-readable summary).
- `00_inbox/FND-ES-000.md` and `00_inbox/FND-ES-001.md` stored verbatim (em-dashes preserved per user directive).
- `seed/FND-ES-norm-000.md` and `seed/FND-ES-norm-001.md` dash-normalized drafts (em-dash ;;; colon, en-dash ;;; semicolon); gitignored per D-004.
- `scripts/plan_keeper.py` cronjob-driven drift detector (idempotent, read-only against GitHub).
- `.gitignore` covering credential, AI-model, and workspace-noise patterns.

### Decisions recorded (open)

- **D-001** Plan-keeper cadence: every 15 minutes + Discord drift ping (subject to user override).
- **D-002** Branch-protection bar: light during skeleton phase, tightened org-wide at Phase 3.5.
- **D-003** Orphan org `Enterprise-Concepts-Model`: untouched (user decision pending).
- **D-004** `seed/` directory: gitignored.
- **D-005** Local workspace: not published as a separate `es-workspace` repo (subject to revisit).

### Pending (awaiting user Proceed)

- Phase 1 ;;; create `.github` profile repo, author org charter, create program board.

### Plan-keeper

- `es-plan-keeper` cronjob scheduled (15-minute cadence). Drift detection limited to repo + project-board drift; phase-status drift detection lands when the program board has items (Phase 1.5+).
